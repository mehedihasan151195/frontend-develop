	<h1>Everything You Need to Know About Computer Hardware   ||| <sub><i>Mehedi Hasan</i></sub></h1>
	<hr>
	<p>Computer hardware refers to the physical components that make up a computer system.</p>
	<p>There are many different kinds of hardware that can be installed inside, and connected to the outside, of a computer.</p>
	<p>Computer hardware may sometimes be seen abbreviated as computer hw.</p>

	<h2><u>List of Computer Hardware</u></h2>
<p>Here are some common individual computer hardware components that you'll often find inside a modern computer. These parts are almost always found inside the computer's housing, so you won't see them unless you open the computer:</p>

<p>The motherboard serves to connect all of the parts of a computer together. The CPU, memory, hard drives, and other ports and expansion cards all connect to the motherboard directly or via cables.

The motherboard is the piece of computer hardware that can be thought of as the "backbone" of the PC, or more appropriately as the "mother" that holds all the pieces together.

Phones, tablets and other small devices have motherboards, too, but they're often called logic boards instead. Their components are usually soldered directly onto the board to save space, which means there aren't expansion slots for upgrades like you see in desktop computers.

The IBM Personal Computer that was released in 1981, is considered to be the very first computer motherboard (it was called a "planar" at the time).

Popular motherboard manufacturers include ASUS, AOpen, Intel, ABIT, MSI, Gigabyte, and Biostar.</p>

<p>A processor (CPU) is the logic circuitry that responds to and processes the basic instructions that drive a computer. The CPU is seen as the main and most crucial integrated circuitry (IC) chip in a computer, as it is responsible for interpreting most of computers commands. CPUs will perform most basic arithmetic, logic and I/O operations, as well as allocate commands for other chips and components running in a computer.

The term processor is used interchangeably with the term central processing unit (CPU), although strictly speaking, the CPU is not the only processor in a computer. The GPU (graphics processing unit) is the most notable example, but the hard drive and other devices within a computer also perform some processing independently. Nevertheless, the term processor is generally understood to mean the CPU.

Processors can be found in PCs, smartphones, tablets and other computers. The two main competitors in the processor market are Intel and AMD.

<p>Random Access Memory, or RAM (pronounced as ramm), is the physical hardware inside a computer that temporarily stores data, serving as the computer's "working" memory.

Additional RAM allows a computer to work with more information at the same time, which usually has a considerable effect on total system performance.</p>

<p>The power supply unit is the piece of hardware that's used to convert the power provided from the outlet into usable power for the many parts inside the computer case.

It converts the alternating current (AC) into a continuous form of power called direct current (DC) that the computer components need in order to run normally. It also regulates overheating by controlling voltage, which might change automatically or manually depending on the power supply.</p>

<p>The video card is an expansion card that allows the computer to send graphical information to a video display device such as a monitor, TV, or projector.

Some other names for a video card include graphics card, graphics adapter, display adapter, video adapter, video controller, and add-in boards (AIBs).

A staggering number of companies manufacture video cards, but almost every one includes a graphics processing unit (GPU) from either NVIDIA Corporation or AMD.</p>

<p>The hard disk drive is the main, and usually largest, data storage hardware device in a computer. The operating system, software titles, and most other files are stored in the hard disk drive.

The hard drive is sometimes referred to as the "C drive" due to the fact that Microsoft Windows, by default, designates the "C" drive letter to the primary partition on the primary hard drive in a computer.</p>

<p>Solid state is a term that refers to electronic circuitry that is built entirely out of semiconductors. The term was originally used to define those electronics such as a transistor radio that used semiconductors rather than vacuum tubes in its construction. Most electronics that we have today are built around semiconductors and chips. In terms of a solid state drive, it refers to the fact that the primary storage medium is through semiconductors rather than a magnetic media such as a hard drive.

<p>Optical drives retrieve and/or store data on optical discs like CDs, DVDs, and BDs (Blu-ray discs), any of which hold much more information than previously available portable media options like the floppy disk.

The optical drive normally goes by other names like a disc drive, â€‹ODD (abbreviation), CD drive, DVD drive, or BD drive.</p>

<p>The monitor is the piece of computer hardware that displays the video and graphics information generated by the computer through the video card.

Monitors are very similar to televisions but usually display information at a much higher resolution. Also unlike televisions, monitors are not usually mounted on a wall but instead sit atop a desk.</p>

<p>The keyboard is the piece of computer hardware used to input text, characters, and other commands into a computer or similar device.

Even though the keyboard is an external peripheral device in a desktop system (it sits outside the main computer housing), or is "virtual" in a tablet PC, it is an essential part of the complete computer system.</p>

<p>The mouse, sometimes called a pointer, is a hand-operated input device used to manipulate objects on a computer screen.

Whether the mouse uses a laser or ball, or is wired or wireless, a movement detected from the mouse sends instructions to the computer to move the cursor on the screen in order to interact with files, windows, and other software elements.

Even though the mouse is a peripheral device that sits outside the main computer housing, it's an essential piece of computer hardware in most systems... at least non-touch ones.</p>

<p>The system unit, also known as a "tower" or "chassis," is the main part of a desktop computer. It includes the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and other components. The system unit also includes the case that houses the internal components of the computer.</p>
